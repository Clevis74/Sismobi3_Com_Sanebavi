The previous AI engineer was tasked with evaluating the Sismobi3_Com_Sanebavi project. Initially, the engineer attempted to read  as per the system prompt, but this file did not exist. Following this, the engineer performed a directory listing and proceeded to read key project files: , , , and . Based on this exploration and the initial system prompt's description of its role as a real estate system analysis expert, the AI engineer then produced a comprehensive evaluation of the Sismobi3_Com_Sanebavi system. This evaluation covered the system's purpose, scope, technical architecture (React, TypeScript, Supabase, Tailwind), functionalities (property/tenant/financial management, Sanebavi utility sharing), user impact, risks, recommended improvements (security, performance, usability), and future expansion opportunities. The final action was presenting this analysis and asking the user for the next steps, either to detail specific aspects or proceed with implementation.

<product_requirements>
The Sismobi3_Com_Sanebavi system is a comprehensive real estate management solution designed for the Brazilian market. Its primary purpose is to centralize and streamline property, tenant, and financial management. A unique and core feature is its integration with Sanebavi (a sanitation company) for automatic, proportional distribution of water and energy bills among tenants. The system aims to provide efficiency, financial control, and compliance for real estate managers.

Key functionalities include:
- Property Management: Registration, status, values, and types.
- Tenant Management: Contracts, payments, documentation, and history.
- Financial Control: Tracking revenues, expenses, ROI, and cash flow.
- Utility Bill Allocation: Intelligent division of water and energy bills based on occupancy or consumption.
- Documentation Management: Handling contracts, technical reports, and personal documents.
- Tax Management: ITR, IPTU.
- Offline-First Capability: Operates without internet, syncing data when reconnected.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer completed a comprehensive, detailed analysis of the Sismobi3_Com_Sanebavi project. This analysis addressed the user's initial request to interpret the system's purpose, evaluate its technical architecture, identify functional strengths and risks, suggest improvements, and outline expansion opportunities. The engineer provided a structured report covering:

1.  **Purpose and Scope**: Identifying the system as a complete real estate management solution with unique Sanebavi integration for utility bill splitting.
2.  **Technical Architecture**: Highlighting strengths like React 18, TypeScript, Supabase, offline-first capabilities, React Query, and Tailwind CSS.
3.  **Functionalities**: Detailing core features such as financial dashboard, contract management, intelligent utility allocation, backup/restore, and a demo mode.
4.  **Impact**: Describing benefits for real estate managers (efficiency, financial control) and organizations (scalability, reliability).
5.  **Risks**: Technical (Supabase dependency, scalability, security) and business (regulation, competition).
6.  **Recommended Improvements**: Focused on security (MFA, encryption), performance (pagination, lazy loading), usability (onboarding, dark mode), and new functionalities (notifications, digital signatures).
7.  **Expansion Opportunities**: Strategic integrations (banking APIs, registries), new features (AI/ML for delinquency prediction, IoT), and market segments.
